Additionally, attendees will implement an archival strategy to keep databases sizes in check.

Attendees will be better able to design a hybrid disaster recovery solution between an on-premises VMWare environment and Azure. In addition,

-   Design a SQL Server scale-out solution

-   Protect database backups from local failures

-   Archive cold data from an on-premises SQL Server

-   Perform end-to-end encryption on sensitive application data

## Step 1: Review the customer case study 

**Outcome** 

Analyze your customer’s needs.

Timeframe: 15 minutes 

Directions: With all participants in the session, the facilitator/SME presents an overview of the customer case study along with technical tips. 

1.  Meet your table participants and trainer 
2.  Read all of the directions for steps 1–3 in the student guide 
3.  As a table team, review the following customer case study


### Customer situation

Fabrikam Publishing is a media and publishing company in Seattle, Washington with approximately 5000 employees. They have a successful direct-to-consumer e-commerce site built with .NET, and they use SQL Server to store customer profile and order information.

Fabrikam has a single data center for both internal and customer-facing applications. Most servers are virtualized on VMware. Application servers primarily run Microsoft server software, including Active Directory (AD) Domain Services and a number of AD-integrated services including Exchange 2013 as well as multi-tier, internal, and AD-integrated Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS)--based web applications with SQL Server 2016 as the database platform.

Recently, the site experienced a multi-day outage due to a lightning strike that disabled both the primary and secondary cooling systems at the data center. In order to avoid such long outages in the future, Fabrikam is investing in a secondary site for disaster recovery. "A disaster recovery site has been on our project proposals for the last four years, but it has always been shelved due to budget constraints," says Michelle Jenkins, Chief Information Officer (CIO). "The recent outage combined with the new capabilities in the cloud have finally encouraged the board to approve the additional budget necessary to build out our disaster recover (DR) capabilities." To keep capital expenditures in check, Fabrikam would like to use the public cloud to host its DR site.

James Sherburn, Director of Information Technology Operations, describes Fabrikam's current disaster recovery strategy as a classic backup/restore strategy with no offsite warm standby machines. Backups are dumped on a network share, and these backups are then archived once per day to an offsite location. According to Sherburn, this strategy requires an "all hands-on deck" approach to recovering the site---which is resource-intensive and slow. It also requires significant expense to bring temporary hardware online at a remote, vendor-provided data center. Because of the cost and complexity, this disaster recovery plan has never been tested, and Information Technology (IT) is not confident that it could bring up the secondary site in a reasonable amount of time. This lack of confidence in the current DR strategy prevented IT management from implementing a failover during the last disaster, resulting in significant losses for the company.

The application team is concerned that the database DR solution will have a negative impact on the overall database performance. The website currently experiences periodic database latency issues during peak load. They would like to have a solution that improves performance of the predominantly read workloads generated by the website to improve the overall responsiveness and the user experience. The Database Architect, Brandon Burns, saw a presentation at a conference last year on leveraging SQL Server Availability Groups with readable secondaries to offload read workloads. Brandon said, "Our ideal solution would be a scale out solution for the data platform, however, we are concerned about potentially making a lot of application code changes." We need a solution that minimizes the amount of changes in the application, and we would like to investigate SQL Server Availability Groups and readable secondaries.

The database administration team is worried about future Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliance issues related to data that is currently stored in varchar fields in the database. In the current system, the database is inaccessible from outside the application except through a dedicated administrative jump-box. Implementing a DR site means that we will be transferring data, and they want to make sure that PCI data being transferred is encrypted. They are concerned about cloud security and the implications it may have to their annual PCI audits. To mitigate any perceived risk and shortcut any issues that may be raised in the PCI audit, they would like to encrypt ALL of the PCI data at both the application and database level.

Future application plans call for new applications that will need to access the encrypted PCI/PII data stored in the database. Key management should be handled by the Fabrikam Security Administration team. They will be responsible for protecting and managing the keys. They need a solution that enables them to accomplish this goal across the multiple applications that will potentially leverage the encrypted database without revealing unencrypted production keys to DBAs or developers.

An additional concern is that the database maintenance jobs are exceeding the current maintenance window. Robert Moore, Manager of Database Administration, believes this is due to the lack of an archive strategy on the current order related tables. Backup times have gradually increased over time to the point where they exceed the maintenance window. Moore's other concern is the sheer size of these databases could make initial synchronization or resynchronization of the DR site a long process that could result in the site running in an exposed state for extended periods. Currently, the database holds approximately 10 years worth of data. "Data older than one year is rarely accessed," says Moore. The business has resisted any data archiving because of several reports that periodically need access to the historical data.

Finally, Fabrikam has a requirement to store the database backups offsite in an encrypted format within two hours of backup completion. The current backup strategy consists of SQL Server backups to an on-premises file server; the backups are then copied to tape and shipped offsite. This process can take up to 24 hours to secure the tapes offsite. In addition to being slow, the tape backups are notoriously unreliable and are generally not available for ad hoc access in the case that a restore becomes necessary. Fabrikam would like to have these backups secured offsite within two hours of the backup completing.

### Customer needs 

1.  Full multi-site disaster recovery solution with minimal complexity, orchestrated failover, and near-zero data loss

2.  Highly available, fault-tolerant SQL Server service with cross-site disaster recovery and minimal impact on database performance

3.  Scale-out the data platform utilizing SQL Server Availability Groups with readable secondaries to offload the heavy read workloads from the primary replica with minimal changes to the application

4.  The ability to seamlessly scale DR site infrastructure as the environment grows

5.  Data encryption solution that encrypts only PCI data at the application and database level

6.  Key management solution that does not expose the unencrypted keys to unauthorized personnel (including DBAs and Developers) and allows for key management by the security administration team

7.  Data archiving to keep database sizes more manageable and reduce the amount of time needed for database maintenance

8.  Secure offsite backups in less than two hours after backup completion

### Customer objections 

1.  Solution must support orchestrated failover so that failover does not require an all hands-on deck

2.  Solution must support the existing VMware infrastructure

3.  Solution must not have a significant impact on database performance

4.  DR infrastructure must be easily scalable to support changes in the workload

5.  The disaster recovery sites must be highly available after a failover

6.  Archive solution must not impact the current applications that periodically pull historical data from the production system

7.  Backups need to be secured offsite in less than two hours.


### Infographic for common scenarios

### Azure Site Recovery

![This is a screenshot of a slide. Common scenarios for Azure Site Recovery include the following bulleted list items: ??? Support for on-premises to on-premises, and on-premises to Azure failover ??? Automated protection and replication of on-premises, Hyper-V, and VMware machines ??? Orchestrated failover ??? Customizable recovery plans ??? Recovery plan testing To the right of the list is a diagram of the multiple deployment architectures of Azure Site Recover: on-premises datacenter to Azure, and on-premises datacenter to on-premises datacenter. At this time, we are unable to capture all of the information in the diagram. Future versions of this course should address this.](images/Whiteboarddesignsessiontrainerguide-SQLServerhybridcloudimages/media/image3.png "Common Azure Site Recovery scenarios")

### Azure Traffic Manager

![This diagram is an example of the Failover traffic routing method for a set of endpoints. In step 1, Traffic Manager first receives an incoming request from a client through DNS and locates the profiles, which is represented as an arrow pointing from a user's laptop to an octagon with arrows inside of it. The octagon has an exploded table with the following columns: Endpoints and Status. The first row has an endpoint of CS-A and a status of Offline (highlighted in red). The second row has an endpoint of CS-B and a status of Online. The third row has an endpoint of CS-C and a status of Online. The fourth row has an endpoint of CS-D and a status of Online. Step 2 is a check of the ordered endpoints. The profile contains an ordered list of endpoints. Traffic Manager check which endpoint is first in the list. If the endpoint is online (based on the ongoing endpoint monitoring), it will specify that endpoint's DNS name in the DNS response to the client. If the endpoint is offline, Traffic Manager determines the next online endpoint in the list. In this example CS-A is offline (unavailable), but CS-B is online (available). In step 3, Traffic Manager returns CS-B's domain name to the client's DNS server, which resolves the domain name to an IP address and sends it to the client. This is represented by an arrow that points from the octagon through DNS to the laptop and user from step one. In step 4, the client initiates traffic to CS-B, which is represented as an arrow that points from the client to an icon of CS-B (Standby 1) at the bottom. To the left of this icon is an icon representing CS-A (Primary), which is in an Offline state. To the right of CS-B are icons representing CS-C (Standby 2) and CS-D (Standby 3).](images/Whiteboarddesignsessiontrainerguide-SQLServerhybridcloudimages/media/image4.png "Diagram of the Failover traffic routing method for a set of endpoints")

### SQL Server Always Encrypted

![On the Trusted side (left), an Apps icon has bidirectional arrows pointing to and from an Enhanced ADO.NET Library icon. At the bottom-left corner is a Column Master Key icon. On the SQL Server side (right), the bidirectional arrows continue and point to and from a database icon. Below this icon is a table with the following columns: Name (dbo.Patients), SSN (ciphertext), and Country. The values in the first row are as follows: Jane Doe, 1x7fg65se2e, and USA. The values in the second row are as follows: Jim Gray, 0x7ff65ae6d, and USA. The values in the third row are as follows: John Smith, 0y8fj75ea2c, and USA. At the bottom-right corner is a Column Encryption Key icon.](images/Whiteboarddesignsessiontrainerguide-SQLServerhybridcloudimages/media/image5.jpeg "SQL Server Always Encrypted diagram")

### SQL Server Stretch Database

![Stretch Database is a feature of SQL Server 2016. On the bottom-left side (on premises) are icons for a Local database (numbered 1) and a User Application (numbered 3 and represented as a monitor). In the Local database icon are tables representing Eligible Data (green) and Local Data (orange). On the top-right side (Azure) is an icon of an Azure SQL database (numbered 2 and labeled Remote Endpoint), and inside this icon is a table representing Remote Data. Two bidirectional arrows (the green one labeled Eligible Data and the orange one labeled T-SQL Queries) point across both sides to and from the local database icon and the Azure SQL database icon. One orange bidirectional arrow labeled T-SQL Queries point to and from the Local database icon and the User Application icon. Below the diagram is the following numbered list: 1. Local database: on-premises instance 2. Remote endpoint: Azure SQL Database holding remote copy 3. Application accessing data](images/Whiteboarddesignsessiontrainerguide-SQLServerhybridcloudimages/media/image6.png "SQL Server Stretch Database diagram")
